# Real Diffusion Reconstruction #
This Software Package can reconstruct real-valued diffusion MRI data (dMRI) by performing phase correction of complex dMRI data. The aim of this reconstruction is to increase dMRI contrast by changing the magnitude noise distribution to zero mean Gaussian background noise. Real diffusion overcomes problems of noise bias, which are typically associated with dMRI data, especially at high spatial resolution and/or strong diffusion weightings. For a full description of the method, see Eichner, C. et al., 2015. 

An example of how to use the software alongside with some toy data can be found in the example.m file.
